# Path Finding "John and the Well" demo

Quite an interesting project, where I had the chance to learn Paper.js and a path finding library. It works really nice, hope you all like it.

## Notes

- Feel free to use, donÂ´t forget to use the last versions of [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) and [pathfinding.js](https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js)
- The design is really simple, I wanted it to have this "old internet page" style, I thought it would look ... cool?
